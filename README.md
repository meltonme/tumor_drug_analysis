## Background
You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, the company began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development in the mice was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment options.

## Analysis

### Drug Regimen Comparison
Comparing all nine drug treatments, along with placebo, shows that Capomulin and Ramicane regimens had a longer survival rate when compared to the other drugs tested.  The remaining drugs had a similar survival rate as compared to placebo, suggesting that they may be ineffective for treating squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
